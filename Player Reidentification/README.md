# ðŸŽ¯ Player Re-Identification in a Single Feed

## Objective

This project simulates **real-time re-identification and tracking** of players in a 15-second video. The task involves detecting players, assigning unique track IDs, and ensuring **consistency of player identity even after occlusion or reappearance**.


## Input

- **Video**: `input.mp4`
- **Model**: Fine-tuned YOLOv11 trained on players and ball.

## Features

- Real-time player detection and tracking using YOLOv11.
- Player re-identification after temporary absence.
- CSV export of tracking results (`frame_number`, `track_id`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`).
